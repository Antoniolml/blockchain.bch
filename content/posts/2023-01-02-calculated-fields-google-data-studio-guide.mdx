In preparation for the [sunset of Universal Analytics
(UA)](https://blog.google/products/marketingplatform/analytics/prepare-for-future-with-google-analytics-4/),
I've been updating my SEO reports to pull data from Google Analytics 4. So I
decided to share how to create calculated fields in Looker Studio (formerly Google
Data Studio). If you are an SEO marketer looking to up the ante with your
reporting, this post is for you.

If you're unfamiliar, [Looker Studio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/overview) is a data visualization platform that allows you to turn your data into compelling stories with visualizations. As an SEO, one of my major pain points is creating effective reporting that provides quantitative results for qualitative efforts. Calculated fields help me resolve that pain point.

While Looker Studio provides plenty of ways to build and share visualizations, creating new or custom fields allows SEOs (and anyone else) to provide better analysis. Let's explore ways to utilize calculated fields to analyze Google Search Console and Google Analytics 4 data in Looker Studio.
